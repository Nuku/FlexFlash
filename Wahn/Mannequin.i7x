"Adds a Neuter Mannequin to Flexible Survival's Wandering Monsters table"

MannequinFirstEncounter is a number that varies.  MannequinFirstEncounter is normally 0.

Section 1 - Monster Responses

to say mannequin wins:
	say "     The living doll grips you tightly and a strange sensation washes over you, as if part of your being is drained away. Before your eyes, its features change, making it look a bit more like yourself. You take your chance while it's distracted with checking out its new body and run away.";

to say mannequin loses:
	say "     The mannequin silently collapses at your feet. Even though it's thoroughly beaten, it still weakly reaches for you, its face showing a desperate expression. You quickly get some road between it and you before it stands up again.";

to say mannequinDesc:
	setmongender 0;	
	if MannequinFirstEncounter is 0:
		say "     Passing by a loading-dock in the warehouse district, you spot two humanoid dogs cutting a hole in the fence and slip through. Curious what the bulldog and german shepherd are doing in there, you inconspicuously follow them between the long rows and stacks of shipping containers.";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     'Which one did the coyote say the food was in?' the shepherd asks gruffly, to which the bulldog replies 'A red one, with Transglobal on the side.' Looking up and down the lines of containers, the shepherd wails 'But almost all of them are red!' The bulldog shrugs and walks over to the nearest container and opens it up. 'Oh hey, seventy flatsceen TVs - how... useless, without electricity. Let's check the next one.'";
		say "     The two of them open up several more containers, but find nothing of use in this post-apocalyptic city. 'I'm beginning to think Diego sent us on a wild goose chase.' the shepherd growls. 'Ok, ok.. let's just open up this last one, then go back to the park and have some words with that coyote...' his buddy replies, then pulls open another container and yelps in surprise. 'Now that's freaky - for a moment I thought this container was full of people.'";
		say "     [line break]";
		say "     The german shepherd steps in front of the door and looks in too. 'Nah, those are just those dress dummies they use in stores. Normal lifeless puppets, see...' and pokes the first mannequin in the container in the chest - which promptly grabs him by the arm. Within moments, dozens of mannequins pour out of the container and wrestle both dogs to the ground. They jostle against each other with a desperate tenacity, each trying to touch one of their captives. Then you see them change, taking on characteristics of the dogs - one growing out a muzzle, another suddenly sprouting fur, etc.";
		say "     After the changes stabilize, all of the mannequins lose interest in their captives and start to disperse, each striking out on its own. Left behind on the ground are two more mannequins - those must be the two former dogs, their essence drained away. As they start to get up too, you decide it's time to leave and make your way back to the hole in the fence. One of the mannequins got there before you, though. It might have absorbed the knowledge of its location from the dogs, or just have been lucky. Now it turns to you, eager to make your shape its own.";
		now MannequinFirstEncounter is 1;
	otherwise:
		say "     You cross paths with an animated mannequin which looks like an idealized male in his mid-twenties, with muscled arms, legs and chest and a featureless crotch. It has a pale flesh-colored skin-tone and a chiseled-looking face including sculpted wavy hair. As the mannequin notices you, an almost desperate, needful look crosses its face and it rushes at you.";

		if humanity of player is less than 10:
			say "As you succumb to the infection, you drift aimlessly through the city and go for anyone crossing your path, overpowering them and absorbing how they look. Being in the form for an unfortunate soldier whose shape you stole earlier almost gets you out of the city when the military finally moves in, but following your unrestrained urges you try assimilating a medic who wants to check you out. Tasered till you collapse, you end up in a small cell and later get shipped to a research lab, where scientists study how you constantly shift and change. As a quite valuable asset for espionage developments, you never leave that facility again...";
			stop the action; [no other endings - player removed from the city]
		otherwise:
			say "Remaining in control of the urges to acquire the shapes of others and become them, you experiment a bit and learn that with some concentration you can shift without leaving others as identity-less infected mannequins. When the military finally moves in, you're taken to a holding facility, where doctors poke and prod you for days on end. Overhearing two doctors talk, you catch '...ites active and in constant flux. The subject wasn't exposed to a one-time change, but something else. That makes [if cocks of player > 0]him[otherwise if cunts of player > 0]her[otherwise]it[end if] far too dangerous to be released. I recommend perm...' Since you don't think you'd get out of there alive - if at all, you use the next chance you get with an orderly and overpower him to flee the facility after absorbing his shape.";
			say "There's quite a bit of panic when people realize you're gone and soldiers swarm out to create roadblocks and hunt for you. It's touch and go for a while, but you manage to avoid capture. A week later and several hundred miles distant, with you laying low in a small town, you think you're home free - until you walk into your motel room and find a man in a suit waiting for you. 'Quite impressive, your escape. We need people like you. A bit of training and you'd make a fine addition to the agency...'";
			say "Recognizing a deal you can't decline, you let yourself be recruited and end up a spy, travelling all over the world. Your ability to become anyone you want to be creates a rumor, then a legend of the super-spy 'The Chameleon'. Eventually movie-directors get a hold of the story and bring out an award-winning series of films about you. You make a game out of appearing as a minor role in every last one of them - never in the same shape twice though.";
